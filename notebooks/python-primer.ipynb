    "Python is currently one of the [fastest growing programming languages](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) in the world. There are many reasons for this trend, but it largely comes down to the fact that Python is easy to learn, has a library or framework for almost everything, and has a large and active community of developers in scientific computing and data analysis. (This last point is very important: if you get stuck, there's a good chance that somebody has already asked your question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)!)  \n",
    "\n",
    "These features have led Python to become one of the most important languages in data science, machine learning, and general software development in academia and industry. Thus, if you're going to learn a new programming language in 2020, then Python is a great choice!\n",

    "Since this is a course on _practical_ data science, we believe that the most effective way to learn data science is to actually _do_ it on a recurring basis. By analogy, you do not need to know the theoretical basis for music in order to learn how to play an instrument! Thus the main goal throughout this semester is to spend the majority of our time working directly with data and code; by the end the semantics of Python and its data analysis libraries will be almost second-nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be introducing several core libraries that underpin much of the work done in data science and machine learning. We will provide more details later in the course, but for now a summary is produced below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) provides the data structures, algorithms, and glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data. It provides blazing fast array-processing capabilities and the ability to do linear algebra operations with ease. (The latter aspect is in part why NumPy underpins much of machine and deep learning applications.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas provides data structures and functions that make working with structured or tabular data fast and simple. The primary objects that we will encounter in this course are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DataFrame`: a tabular, column-oriented data structure with row and column labels;\n",
    "* `Series`: a 1d labelled array object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**matplotlib**\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib is the defacto Python library for producing plots and other data visualisations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**scikit-learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn is the defacto machine learning toolkit for Python. It includes submodules such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification: SVM, nearest neighbours, random forest, logistic regression etc;\n",
    "* Regression: Lasso, ridge regression;\n",
    "* Clustering: $k$-means, etc;\n",
    "* Model selection: Grid search, cross-validation, metrics\n",
    "* Preprocessing: Feature extraction, normalisation\n",

Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks are made of _cells_ and there are two basic types of cell that you'll encounter:\n",

    "## Basic data types\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is based on Stanford's excellent NumPy [tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) and Wes McKinney's _Python for Data Analysis_ book - go check them out for more details! Like most languages, Python has a number of basic data types including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integers\n",
    "* Floats (double-precision 64-bit floating point number)\n",
    "* Booleans (True or False)\n",
    "* Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "These data types behave in ways that are familiar from other programming languages. However, there are some important differences. For example statically typed languages like C or Java require each variables to be explicitly declared. By contrast, dynamically typed languages like Python skip this specification. For example, in Java you might specify an operation as follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/* Java code */\n",
    "int result = 0;\n",
    "for(int i=0; i<100; i++){\n",
    "    result += i;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "while in python the same operation could be written this way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "result = 0\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    result += i\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note the main difference: in Java the data types of each variable are explicitly declared, while in Python the types are dynamically inferred. This means we can assign **_any kind of data to any variable_**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "x = \"four\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we switched the contents of `x` from an integer to a string. The same thing in Java would lead to a compilation error or some other disaster:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/* Java code */\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "x = \"four\"; // FAILS!\n",
    "```\n",
    "This sort of flexibility makes Python easy (and sometimes dangerous!) to use."
