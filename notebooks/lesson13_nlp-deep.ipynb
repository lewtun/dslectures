    "Last time we built a sentiment classifier with `scikit-learn` and achieved around 85% accuracy on the test set. This is already pretty good, but can we do better? We are still wrong 15/100 times. It turns out we can if we use deep learning.\n",

    "Deep learning uses an architecture that is modeled after the brain and uses networks of artificial neurons to mimic its behaviour. These models are much bigger than the models we encountered so far and can have millions to billions of parameters. Training these models and adjusting the parameters is also more challenging, and generally requires much more data and compute. A lot of computations are easily parallelizable, which is a strength of modern GPUs. Therefore we will run this notebook on a GPU that enables much faster training than a CPU.\n",

    "## Transfer learning\n",
    "Training deep learning models requires a lot of data. It is not uncommon to train models on millions of images or gigabytes of text data to achieve good results. Most real-world problems don't have that amount of labeled data ready, and not all companies or individuals who want to train a model can afford to hire people to label data for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years this has been very challenging. Fortunately, it has been solved for image based models a couple of years ago and recently also for NLP. One approach that helps train models with limited labeled data is called **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that once a model is trained on a large dataset for a specific task (e.g., classifying houses vs. planes), the model has learned certain features of the data that can be reused for another task. Such features could be how to detect edges or textures in images. If these features are useful for another task, then we can train the model on new data without requiring as many labels as if we were training it from scratch."

    "### ULMFiT\n",
    "For transfer learning in NLP Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder came up with a similar approach called `ULMFiT` (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification) for texts. The central theme of the approach is language modeling."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Language modeling\n",
    "In language modeling the goal is to predict the next word based on the previous word in a text. An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Yesterday I discovered a really nice cinema so I went there to watch a ____ .`\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of the model is to fill the blank. The advantage of language modeling is that it does not require any labels, but to achieve good results, the model needs to learn a lot about language. In this example, the model needs to understand that one watches movies in cinemas. The same goes for sentiment and other topics. With `ULMFiT` one can train a language model and then use it for classifications tasks in three steps."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Three steps\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src='images/ulmfit_approach.png' width='800'>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Language model (wiki)**: A language model is trained on a large dataset. Wikipedia is a common choice for this task as it includes many topics, and the text is of high quality. This step usually takes the most time on the order of days. In this step, the model learns the general structure of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Language model (domain)**: The language model trained on Wikipedia might be missing some aspects of the domain we are interested in. If we want to do sentiment classification, Wikipedia does not offer much insight since Wikipedia articles are generally of neutral sentiment. Therefore, we continue training the language model on the text we are interested in. This step still takes several hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classifier (domain)**: Now that the language model works well on the text we are interested in, it is time to build a classifier. We do this by adapting the output of the network to yield classes instead of words. This step only takes a couple of minutes to an hour to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this approach is that you only need little labeled data for the last step and only need to go through the expensive first step once. Even the second step can be reused on the dataset if you, for example, build a sentiment classifier and additionally a topic classifier. This can be done in minutes and allows us to achieve great results with little time and resources."

    "We will train a variant of a model called LSTM (long short-term memory) network. This is a neural network with a feedback loop. That means that when fed a sequence of tokens, it feeds back its output for the next prediction. With this the model has a mechanism remembering the past inputs. This is especially useful when dealing with sequential data such as texts, where the sequence of words and characters carries important meaning.\n",

So we want to find the spot where the loss function decreases the steepest with the largest learning rate. In this case, a good value is `1e-2`.

    "Deep learning models learn more and more abstractions with each layer. The first layers of an image model might learn about edges and textures in an image, and as you progress through the layers, you can see how the model combines edges to eyes or ears and eventually combines these to faces. Therefore the last few layers are usually the ones that are very task-specific while the others contain general information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we usually start by just tuning the last few layers because we don't want to lose that information and then, in the end, fine-tune the whole model. This is what we did above: we just trained the last few layers. Now to get the best possible performance, we want to train the whole model. The `unfreeze()` function enables the training of the whole model. We train the model for 10 more epochs with a slightly lower learning rate."
