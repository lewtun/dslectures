    "## What is this thing called data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a big deal in business these days, and with good reasons. Amongst them (Loukides, 2010):\n",
    "* Almost every aspect of a business is open to data collection, be it web server logs, tweet streams, IoT sensors, online transactions, or some other source. Data science provides techniques to extract useful information from this data and thus generate added value;\n",
    "* The question facing every company, startup, and non-profit that wants to attract a community in the modern era is how to use data _effectively._ Using data effectively requires something different from traditional statistics; namely an interdisciplinary approach that involves elements of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise. Data science is the methodology that synthesises these three domains (Fig. 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, data science is about the extraction of useful information and knowledge from\n",
    "large volumes of data, in order to improve business decision-making (Provost & Fawcett, 2013). With improved decision making comes improved productivity, market value, and competitive edge. Thus the main goal of data science is to enable data-driven decision making across the whole company (Fig. 1), where decisions are based on the analysis of data rather than pure intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many challenges involved with making data science an effective component of a business, but for those that succeed (Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn) the rewards are immense."

The classroom sessions will involve a mix of theoretical and practical (programming) work, with an emphasis on the latter. The self-study tasks will be used to read selected chapters from the module textbook and complete ungraded programming assignments. The outline for the module is shown in the table below."

This test has a maximum score of 10 points and will be held on XXXX.\n",
    "2. **Group project:** Students will be allocated into small groups and tasked to solve an end-to-end data science project. The results from the analysis must be submitted in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, followed by a 15 minute oral presentation to the class. The maximum score for this assessment is 50 points, evenly distributed across the analysis code and presentation.\n",
    "3. **Written examination:** The final written examination will consist of multiple choice and short answer questions, covering the content of the lectures and the module textbook. Students will not be required to solve any Python programming questions in the exam. The exam has a maximum score of 40 points and will take place on XXXX"
