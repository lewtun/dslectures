    "## What is this thing called data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a big deal in business these days, and with good reasons. Amongst them (Loukides, 2010):\n",
    "* Almost every aspect of a business is open to data collection, be it web server logs, tweet streams, IoT sensors, online transactions, or some other source. Data science provides techniques to extract useful information from this data and thus generate added value;\n",
    "* The question facing every company, startup, and non-profit that wants to attract a community in the modern era is how to use data _effectively._ Using data effectively requires something different from traditional statistics; namely an interdisciplinary approach that involves elements of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise. Data science is the methodology that synthesises these three domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, data science is about the extraction of useful information and knowledge from\n",
    "large volumes of data, in order to improve business decision-making (Provost & Fawcett, 2013). With improved decision making comes improved productivity, market value, and competitive edge. Thus the main goal of data science is to enable data-driven decision making across the whole company (Fig. 1), where decisions are based on the analysis of data rather than pure intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many challenges involved with making data science an effective component of a business, but for those that succeed (Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn) the rewards are immense."

    "The module structure consists of classroom sessions, self-study tasks, and group work. The classroom sessions will involve a mix of theoretical and practical (programming) work, with an emphasis on the latter. The self-study tasks will be used to read selected chapters from the module textbook and complete ungraded programming assignments. The outline for the module is shown in the table below.\n",

    "## Cloud environment\n",
    "We will be teaching most of the class via Jupyter notebooks in Python. The notebooks for each class will be made available from links on this website. Note that some parts of the notebooks are removed for you to fill in as you follow along in class. You can open and run them directly on binder by clicking on the binder badge (see example below) at the top of each lecture notebook. We highly encourage the use of binder, since it requires no local installation and runs for free. \n",

    "A few remarks about binder:\n",
    "1. Binder is free to use.\n",
    "2. If you edit a notebook make sure to download the notebooks, since binder does not store your changes.\n",
    "3. Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave your window open, this will be counted as “activity”).\n",
    "4. Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session. Beyond that, it is not guaranteed that the session will remain running.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download/Upload\n",
    "Since binder does not store your changes permanently you should download the notebooks you worked on at the end of your session. If you want to continue your session you can re-upload them to binder. See the image below for instructions how to upload/download.\n",

    "You can also install the data science lecture material locally. In general when working with Python it is recommended to use [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). This makes sure that packages you install don't interfere with packages you already installed in other projects.\n",

    "Then make sure you download all course material from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lewtun/dslectures) or just the missing notebooks. In general you will need to copy all materials, since some resources such as images are not self-contained in the notebooks.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Written mid-term test:** The mid-term test will consist of multiple choice and short-answer questions, covering content from the first seven lectures and chapters 1–4 of the module textbook Data Science for Business (see references below). This test has a maximum score of 10 points and will be held on April 16th.\n",
    "2. **Group project:** Students will be allocated into small groups and tasked to solve an end-to-end data science project. The results from the analysis must be submitted in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, followed by a 15 minute oral presentation to the class. The maximum score for this assessment is 50 points, evenly distributed across the analysis code and presentation.\n",
    "3. **Written examination:** The final written examination will consist of multiple choice and short answer questions, covering the content of the lectures and the module textbook. Students will not be required to solve any Python programming questions in the exam. The exam has a maximum score of 40 points and the final date will lie somewhere between June 29th and July 17th."
